  <h2>First post! A bit about myself</h2>

<p>Here goes nothing!...</p><p>I've been meaning to start a technical blog for such a long time but never got around to doing it. I have learned and consumed so much quality content from so many great minds in our industry over the years, I'm hoping I can finally contribute something worthwhile and interesting.</p>
<br>
<h3>A bit about me</h3>
  <p>My name is <b>Michael</b> and I am among many other things an information security professional. I've spent most of my career specializing in incident response and threat hunting. I've done quite a bit of detection engineering in recent years as well and I hope I could write quite a bit about all these things some day. <p>Red-teaming is another pursuit of mine, although I haven't dedicated as much time to it as I would have liked.
  <br>
  <p>Work and careers aside, I've spent a lot of time in recent years practicing and improving my offensive security skills. Knowing about attack techniques and tactics is one thing, developing practical skills executing those attacks is another. I learned that very quickly when I first attempted the OSCP exam. I was reminded of that fact again by the my first attempt at the OSED certification as well (I'm glad to say I've passed both exams now). I have consistently gained skills and knowledge that has helped me become a better security professional by practicing and studying offensive security in general. I consider offensive-security -- thinking and practicing like a hacker -- a foundation upon which all other technical skills are built in infosec.</p>

  <p>Recently, I wanted to focus less on certifications and formal pursuits and more on passion-projects and research. I have so many ideas for tools, attack-techniques and other proejcts, and that's what I have been focusing on, as free-time permits.</p><br>
  <p>Ater passing my OSED, I wanted to practice exploit development so much, learn and practice vulnerability research and so much more. However, I found myself studying EDRs and how to evade them, learning how they work. That happened to intersect with some of the more advanced exploitation labs and EDR-evasion techniques I've had my eye on, which mostly involve Windows kernel-mode drivers,how to exploit them and how they're used to implement modern EDRs. That as a result is what I've been spending a lot of my time studying in the past few months. I am planning on writing about what I've learned so far and refocusing on developing PoC exploits.</p>

  <br><p>Infosec aside, I am huge fan of sci-fi. Books, movies, shows, I'm all for it!</p>

  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>I started looking into how to host a blog in 2025. There are endless options but I kept returning to simpler approaches.</p>
  <p>Github pages does a great job of out-sourcing the hosting and site-management side of things. But static-site-generators like Jekyll just seem to lack character. Being a personal blog site and all, I saw it fitting to use a format I myself like and appreciate greatly: Simple HTML sites with a very light touch of CSS. Let me know what you think of this site and how I'm doing so far.</p>
<br><p>Thanks for visiting my blog and stay tuned for more posts from me.</p>
